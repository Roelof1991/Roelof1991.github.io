- IOS GRAPHICAL INTERFACE FOR USER-GENERATED MODULAR TEXT-BASED RPGS
Summary: A server-backed iOS application that functions as a platform for user generated content of text-based RPGs. Users can download the application in the App Store, and then users can create their own stories with graphical transitional effects between text-based scenes. In each scene a reader has to choose between several choices that impacts the story differently. This application serves as a platform to serve these user generated stories. Not only does the application function as content distribution, the application will also serve as a platform for content creators. The application serves as both content consumption and creation.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
